# Product Impact Analysis

## Project Overview

This project conducts a product level sales analysis to understand how revenue and margin evolve with the introduction of new products. It aims to investigate the impact of new product launches on various key performance indicators (KPIs) such as conversion rates, average order value (AOV), and revenue per session. Additionally, the project explores product-level website pathing, product conversion funnels, cross-selling analysis, and the effects of product portfolio expansion.

## Key Objectives

- Analyze baseline sales data to understand initial revenue and margin performance.
- Assess the impact of new product launches on conversion rates and revenue per session.
- Examine website user behavior in relation to product pageviews and subsequent actions.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of product conversion funnels.
- Investigate the outcomes of cross-selling strategies.
- Analyze the effects of expanding the product portfolio on critical business metrics.
  
## Insights and Findings

- **Baseline Analysis**: Initial queries focused on understanding sales, revenue, and margin before any new product launch.
- **New Product Impact**: Analysis aimed to determine if improvements in conversion rates and revenue per session were attributable to new product launches or general business growth.
- **Website Pathing**: Investigation into user behavior post-product page visit revealed shifts in click-through rates and preferences between products, indicating cannibalization effects among product offerings.
- **Conversion Funnels**: Detailed funnel analysis highlighted the journey from product page visits to final purchases, showcasing differences in conversion rates between products.
- **Cross-Selling Analysis**: Despite positive trends in metrics such as products per order and revenue per cart session, cross-selling efforts were not deemed game-changing.
- **Product Portfolio Expansion**: Launching a third product showed improvements in conversion rates, AOV, products per order, and revenue per session, indicating the benefits of expanding the product range.
