# Seasonal Traffic Insights for Strategic Planning

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze seasonality in website traffic and order volume, using data from the previous year to prepare for the upcoming year. By examining patterns in website sessions and orders, we aim to gain insights that can guide staffing and marketing strategies to optimize for both regular and peak traffic periods.

## Key Objectives

- Identify patterns of seasonality in website traffic and orders.
- Understand daily and hourly traffic trends to improve customer service efficiency.
- Utilize historical data to forecast and prepare for future demand.\
  
## Insights and Findings

Our analysis revealed a steady growth in website traffic throughout the year, with a significant increase in volume during the holiday months. This pattern suggests the need for strategic planning around these peak periods to maximize sales and customer satisfaction.

Further investigation into daily and hourly traffic patterns indicated that the hours between 8AM and 5PM experience the highest volume of website sessions. This insight is crucial for optimizing customer service resources, suggesting a need to double staffing during these hours to handle increased inquiries and support requests.
