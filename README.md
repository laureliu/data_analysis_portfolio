# Haiqing (Laurel) Liu - Data Analytics & Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analytics and Data Science portfolio! This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of my expertise and projects in the realms of data analysis, machine learning, SQL databases, and interactive dashboards. Through rigorous data exploration, insightful analysis, and the application of advanced algorithms, I aim to solve real-world problems and generate actionable insights.

## Projects Overview

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visual storytelling with data through dynamic and interactive dashboards designed in Tableau/Power BI, providing insightful views into complex datasets.
- **SQL Databases**: Demonstrations of complex SQL queries, database design, and optimization techniques for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Python for Data Analysis**: A collection of notebooks featuring data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis using pandas, NumPy, and other Python libraries to uncover trends and patterns.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn and TensorFlow to predict outcomes, classify data, and uncover insights from both structured and unstructured data.

## What You'll Find

Each project folder contains:
- A comprehensive README that outlines the project's objective, methodology, tools used, and key findings.
- Source code, including Jupyter notebooks, SQL scripts, and dashboard files, with detailed comments explaining the logic and techniques employed.
