## Python Projects

### [YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/laureliu/data_analysis_portfolio/tree/main/Youtube%20Text%20Analysis)
This project focuses on analyzing sentiments of YouTube comments and engagement metrics of YouTube videos across different categories. It includes sentiment analysis, word cloud visualization, emoji usage analysis, and engagement rate comparisons, employing libraries like TextBlob for sentiment analysis and seaborn for visualization.

### [Breast Cancer Classification](https://github.com/laureliu/data_analysis_portfolio/tree/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Classification)
The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors into malignant or benign categories. Utilizing the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, this project involved exploratory data analysis, feature scaling, model selection (SVC model), and parameter tuning with GridSearchCV for optimal performance.

## SQL Projects

### [Traffic Source Analysis and Optimization](https://github.com/laureliu/data_analysis_portfolio/tree/main/Traffic%20Source%20Analysis)
This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing web traffic sources for an e-commerce platform. By examining website sessions, orders, and conversion rates, the project aims to identify top traffic sources, assess their effectiveness, and optimize bidding strategies for paid traffic. The analysis is grounded on data extracted from website_sessions and orders tables, focusing on key metrics such as session counts, order counts, and conversion rates.

### [Website Traffic and Conversion Analysis](https://github.com/laureliu/data_analysis_portfolio/tree/main/Website%20Traffic%20and%20Conversion%20Analysis)
This project aims to analyze website traffic, page views, bounce rates, and conversion paths on a website to identify areas for improvement and understand customer behavior better. By examining the most-viewed pages, entry pages, bounce rates, and conversion rates, the website manager can make informed decisions to optimize the site for better user engagement and increased conversions.
